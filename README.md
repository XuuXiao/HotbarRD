# HotbarRD

### Created by [Xu Xiaolan](https://github.com/XuuXiao) (art) and [VELD-Dev](https://github.com/VELD-Dev "Github profile") (coding).

A mod that replaces the regular blue boring box hotbar with a custom hotbar from a selection of over 20 hotbars with different designs and colours!

Bugs:
-Hotbars are rotated different for almost each hotbar box, could probably be fixed by overlaying the hotbar with the border art and making the actual hotbar super transparent, might cause problem compatibility with HotbarPlus and ReservedItemSlots though.
